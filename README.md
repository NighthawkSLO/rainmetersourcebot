#What is this?
/u/rainmetersourcebot is a bot created by [/u/pandemic21](https://reddit.com/u/pandemic21) (thank you!) that is here to help enforce rule B1. 
> 1. If you share a completed setup, **provide download links** to skins and wallpapers shown **within three hours** of posting.

This is one of the many changes that are going on to improve your subreddit experience here at /r/rainmeter.
#Why Rule B1?
Rule B1 is the hardest to enforce, and one of the easiest to abuse. This is why this bot was implemented for rule B1, and not for something like the bullying rule.

* Temporarily remove your post if you don't have download links
